# PrediksiStatusPeminjaman-MLProject
This is a Machine Learning project  about loan status predictions.  I used the Support Vector Machine algorithm with Python. I utilized several libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn. Here, we can determine whether someone's loan is approved or not by inputting the data.
